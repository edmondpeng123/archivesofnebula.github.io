        </h>
        <h class="endnotes hidden">Archives of Nebula uses a website as a vessel for a journal that follows the
            footprints of an astronaut from the future who got lost inside a black hole. The archive is decorated with
            interactive and playful motifs to replicate the diversity of cosmic matter (plasma, cosmic rays, stars,
            particles) that exists in a galaxy. The narrative is conceptualised by themes of loneliness, escapism
            through imagination, absurdism and connection. The concept of extraterrestrial life is inspired by the main
            three philosophies of existence: existentialism, nihilism and absurdism. Archives of Nebula strives to
            immerse the viewer into its world and allow their experience to become the interpretation.

            <br /> <br />
            My intentions were initially to create an educational narrative about the philosophies of existence, but
            I've decided to focus more so on the story-telling aspect of this project. In spite of that, the design
            consist of a mix-match of both a world-building website and a journal/entry/diary formatted website. The goal 
            of the project is to immerse the user into this world and make them forget about their own reality for a few minutes
            which relates to how the mysterious astronaut felt. Archives of Nebula brings light to the immersive
            characteristics of the digital realm and the other-worldly feeling of experiencing a whole world inside the Internet.
            They are many ways to interpret the narrative and
            each of those interpretations are unique to each viewer.
